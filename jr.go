/*
JR is a CLI program that helps you to create quality random data for your applications.

JR is very straightforward to use. To list existing templates:
> jr list

Templates are in the directory $JR_SYSTEM_DIR/jr/templates.
You can override with the --system_dir command flag. Templates with parsing issues are showed in red, Templates with no parsing issues are showed in green

To use for example one of the predefined templates, net_device:

> jr template run net_device

Using -n option you can create more data in each pass. This example creates 3 net_device objects at once:

> jr template run net_device -n 3

Using --frequency option you can repeat the creation every f milliseconds. This example creates 2 net_device every second, for ever:

> jr template run net_device -n 2 -f 1s

Using --duration option you can time bound the entire object creation. This example creates 2 net_device every 100ms for 1 minute:

> jr template run net_device -n 2 -f 100ms -d 1m
